# CIGAR-COIL-PROTECTION-BRACKET

## Challenge
This is with a very common component of an spark ignited engines and is known as Ignition Coil or commonly known as Cigar Coil. This is a type of coil on plug system. Due its very delicate design and low strength of materials are utilized, frequent failure was present and cause us losses in terms of vehicle uptime reduction as vehicles are getting breakdown very often due to this part failure. Also as high voltage is present in this component as high as 24000 volts and if this components gets come in contact with any other nearby other engine electronic components due to its loosed mounting and other nearby components may failed easily and if this high voltage reached to ECU somehow, major loss will be there.

## Solution: Designed in house CIGAR COIL PROTECTION BRACKET
a) Solved issue of broken mounting: 
CIGAR COIL PROTECTION BRACKET was made of PA-2200 plastic material which has 30% glass present in it and due to this, it can able to withstand temperatures of as high as 300 degrees celcius very easily and also this is very high strength material. In order to withstand upto 10 times of existing force, we increased wall thickness. 

b) Solved issue of broken supply connectors: 

c) Easy to deploy(no skill required) within 5 minutes using push-fitting with very light force only. Also this part can also be fitted to over newer part so that premature failure of cigar coil will not be seen in future. 

d) Rigourous 1 month testing on single bus followed by deployment to whole bus fleet of delhi transit buses.

## IMPACT
1,740 CIGAR COIL PROTECTION BRACKETS were deployed in staggered manner to fleet of 310 delhi transit buses. Daily breakdown of buses due to above mentioned issues were reduced from 25-30 to 1-2 issues per month only. Resuability of existing cigar coil has been drastically improved and monthly new inventory requirement has been reduced from 40-50 qty to 15-20 per month.
